# SurveillanceCameraMan.com Source Code https://SurveillanceCameraMan.com
Please create as many mirrors as you want. Do so on both the clear-net and the deep web.

## How To Install
I am assuming you have basic knowledge of how to set up back end like PHPBB and PHP & MYSQL.
The source code provided, only includes the front end. If you want to mirror the forum, you will have to set up your own backend.

## Hosting your mirror on the clear-net
If you are hosting your mirrored version of SurveillanceCameraMan.com on the clear-net. There are few things you **MUST** set up first.

###### Buy A Domain Name
There are many services you can use to register you domain name. I like to use https://namecheap.com
**It is recommended that you purchase an SSL certificate alongside your domain name.**
The browser may recognize your website as a security risk if you don't have an SSL.

###### Set up a web server (e.g. Apache, nGinx, IIS)
Once you have your domain name and SSL certificate. Set up the web server that will be hosting the website.
You can choose to host the website with a hosting provider like https://namecheap.com. 
You can also set up a localhost.

###### Set permissions on your web server
On a localhost. Set the authentication permissions on the directory that will allow users to access the website from the internet.

###### If everything is configured correctly, you should recieve no errors.
